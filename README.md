This project was implemented with the ultimate goal of creating a simple shell.
The design and implementation was intended to exhibit understanding of working with the CLI, prototypes of the main function and system calls.Some of the milestone accomplished are:
        1. How to use the shell to execute another program using the execve system call

        2. Using the PATH to find other programs

        3. Manipulating the environment of a running process

        4. Suspending the execution of a process until one of its children process terminates

        5. Handling process interuptions or failures
